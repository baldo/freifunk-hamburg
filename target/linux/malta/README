This Malta target is intended to be used with the Qemu emulator. It can be used
to prototype an OpenWrt firmware for MIPS processors. One could also use it to
troubleshoot MIPS applications without access to real hardware.

To use the images built by OpenWrt with qemu, use the following commands:

qemu-system-mipsel -kernel bin/malta/openwrt-malta-vmlinux.elf -nographic

and enjoy the system bootin.
