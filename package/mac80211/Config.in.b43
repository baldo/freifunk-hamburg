# B43 configuration

choice
	prompt "b43 firmware version"
	depends on PACKAGE_kmod-b43
	default B43_EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  This option allows you to select the version of the b43 firmware.

config B43_STABLE
	bool "4.150.10.5 (stable)"
	help
	  Stable firmware for BCM43xx devices.

	  If unsure, select this.

config B43_EXPERIMENTAL
	bool "4.178.10.4 (experimental)"
	help
	  Experimental firmware for BCM43xx devices.

	  This firmware is not tested as much as the "stable" firmware.

	  If unsure, select the "stable" firmware.

config B43_OPENFIRMWARE
	bool "Open FirmWare for WiFi networks"
	help
	  Opensource firmware for BCM43xx devices.

	  Do _not_ select this, unless you know what you are doing.
	  The Opensource firmware is not suitable for embedded devices, yet.
	  It does not support QoS, which is bad for AccessPoints.
	  It does not support hardware crypto acceleration, which is a showstopper
	  for embedded devices with low CPU resources.

	  If unsure, select the "stable" firmware.
